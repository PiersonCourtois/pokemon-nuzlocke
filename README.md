## About

This is a Pokemon Scarlet/Violet nuzlocke helper. Due to how the new games deal with random encounters, it is difficult to be able to have a "random" first encounter while allowing a player to be able to get all Pokemon in that area. This app fixes that by randomly selecting a Pokemon from the available pool for a certain area.

## Features
- Randomize a Pokemon for each area
- Rolling animation with option to skip
- Option to include night Pokemon
- Option to allow for duplicates
- Run is saved until reset
- Rolled Pokemon's Bulbapedia button
- Level caps for every Gym, Team Star, and Titans
- Spinning leaf!
